Some notes about numpy

	Using np.empty instead of np.zeros is faster; puts in random values
	
	If you multiply or divide arrays of the same size, operation done element 
	by element
	
	axis 0 for rows, axis 1 for columns
	
	Broadcasting is a mechanism that allows numpy to perform operations on 
	arrays of different shapes, if the shapes are compatible
