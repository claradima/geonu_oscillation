I want to figure out why the memory doesn't get overwhelmed if I split it into sublayers, given that I still have to make the whole array (big cube, 20km spacing) in the beginning. The first cell will be copied from Mantle layering (as far as I remember, this is the last version of the script that produces all the flux and ratio plots thatwe want):\n",
